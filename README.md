## Getting Started
CD to your project.

If you haven't already, it's best to init a git repository so nvim knows this is the route of the project.

You can open the project in two ways

1. Type "nvim" this will open up the project with the Telescope File Finder as your first view. It's useful but it can look a little intimidating.

2. Type "nvim ." This will open a buffer with the oil plug-in which gives you a view of the top level of your structure. It's a slightly gentler way to start working.
